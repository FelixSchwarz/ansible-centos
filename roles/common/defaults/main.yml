# I hoped that SELinux basically "just" works in CentOS but it doesn't. Even
# common services like exim, dovecot and chronyd want to use DBUS but they are
# blocked...
# I don't see huge value in having SELinux so disable it for now (and reconsider
# this decision in CentOS 8 as SELinux seems to work fine Fedora 23).
