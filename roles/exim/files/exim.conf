# authenticated users).

# Basically port 465 is indeed legacy (though still in use by Outlook 2011/Mac
# and the default for "SSL/TLS" in Thunderbird) but helpful for testing
# certificate configuration with the openssl command-line client:
# openssl s_client -showcerts -connect mail.schwarz-online.org:465 -servername 'mail.schwarz-online.org'
